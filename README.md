# operations-workflow-automation
Top level repo to organize exploration and experiments for operations workflow automation.  A few ideas after surveying other repositories, presentations and articles.

I have in mind a framework that includes:

* choosing performance metrics, what kind of metrics
* simulations - for testing, benchmarking and development of automation
* instrumentation guide - how to monitor and alert
* automated alert grouping using unsupervised machine learning - early detection AND grouping of alerts into related sets in real time
* anomaly detection for metrics and log data
* incorporation of NLP on operations chatter to 1) recognize systemic problems 2) to provide problem classification of training data for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms
* automating root cause analysis workflows 1) anomoly pattern search 2) exploratory analysis of metrics, learning root cause patterns and mapping to runbooks
* data visualization for anomaly investigation
* compensation mechanisms - automating responses to problems
